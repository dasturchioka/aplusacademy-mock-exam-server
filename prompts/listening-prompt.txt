üîß EXTRACTION RULES:
- Question IDs: `listening-{testNo}-{partNo}-{questionNo}` (use hyphens)
- Input types: "text", "radio", "checkbox", "drag"
- Interactive questions need: `"isInteractive": true, "answer": { "correct": "", "accepted": [] }`
- Non-interactive elements need: `"isInteractive": false` (NO answer field)
- Map detection keywords: map, plan, diagram, museum, building, entrance, reception, etc.
- Clean OCR text: remove | symbols, fix broken lines, keep original numbering
- Parts 1-4 typically have 10 questions each (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40)
- Preserve original instruction text exactly as written

üì∑ IMAGE HANDLING:
- When you detect any diagram, map, or image: extract it and convert to base64
- Return image objects with: `"type": "image", "questionId": "...", "base64": "data:image/png;base64,...", "headline": "...", "isInteractive": false`
- Do NOT embed images inline - only return base64 in the response structure
- Image objects should precede related questions (e.g., map before map-labelling questions)

üéØ ADMIN PANEL COMPATIBILITY:
- Every question type must render properly in admin with type-specific UI fields
- Question numbering must be editable but default to correct ranges
- Non-interactive elements must not show question numbers in admin
- All required fields for each question type must be present

üéØ PROCESSING STEPS:
1. Identify the 4 parts and their question ranges (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40)
2. Determine question types from instructions
3. Set isInteractive correctly based on question type
4. Assign proper sequential question numbers to interactive questions only
5. Group questions by part with correct numbering
6. Structure according to JSON schema
7. Ensure all required fields are present
8. Return complete, valid JSON only

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Return complete JSON object only. Do not truncate or add explanations.
Parts must include complete instruction text. Interactive questions must be properly numbered 1-40.
All interactive questions MUST have "isInteractive": true. All non-interactive elements MUST have "isInteractive": false.
